Agree on a data structure for the map (sad char *[])

-- INIT
	- PARSING:
		- mmap colors
		- door textures
		- door char in map
		- base fov ?
		- base speed ?
		- minimap size ?
		- view angle ?
	- add doors in 1 by 1 hole (check for close doors)


-- HOOKS

-- GAME
	- Fixed tick rate ?

-- PLAYER
	- calc speed

-- MINIMAP
	- rotate around player ? (have player always looking in the same dir)

-- COLISION
	- calc colision during movements -> Need to check corners not sides, also mby do it with ray tracing and not boring add ?
	- DAMN ITS FUCKED, FIX IT

-- SETTINGS:
	- fov
	- mouse sensibility
	- antialiasing ?
	- movements key bind?
	-  mmap size

-- RENDER
	- print textures: add a struct for the data of the wall projection (height, len, percent of wall shown)
