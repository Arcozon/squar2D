Agree on a data structure for the map

-- INIT
	- add doors in 1 by 1 hole, check for close doors

-- HOOKS

-- GAME
	- Fixed tick rate ?

-- Minimap
	- add vision
	- Why is it changing the rest of the screen ? -- IDK

-- PLAYER
	- calc speed
	- calc colision during movements -> Need to check corners not sides, also mby do it with ray tracing and not boring add ?



-- SETTINGS:
	- fov
	- mouse sensibility
	- antialiasing ?
	- movements key bind?

-- RENDER
	- calc range
	- print textures: add a struct for the data of the wall projection (height, len, percent of wall shown)
